👋 Hi, I'm Matthew (he/him/his)! I'm an Offensive Security Engineer at HashiCorp. 🕵️

I like to work on or think about C2 infrastructure, macOS, OSINT, physical security, foreign affairs. 📚

I've pinned some of my recent public work below 📌 and I also contribute to other open source projects like [Mythic](https://github.com/its-a-feature/Mythic), [HealthInspector](https://github.com/its-a-feature/HealthInspector), and [SwiftBelt](https://github.com/cedowens/SwiftBelt). 🤝
